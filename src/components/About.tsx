            Growing up in Nagpur, I tried everything. Swimming pools at 5 AM. Basketball courts after school. 
            Archery ranges on weekends. Photography walks. Music lessons. Art classes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I was searching for something that would make me feel... <em>alive</em>.
          </p>
          
          <p>Nothing clicked.</p>
          
          <p>
            School felt like a factory line. Life felt like checking boxes. And the advice? Always the same: 
            "Do this, it pays well."
          </p>
          
          <p>
            No one asked what made my eyes light up. No one wondered who I could become â€” only what I could earn.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            By my second year of college, I broke down completely. Everyone around me seemed to know exactly 
            where they were going. I felt invisible, drifting in a world that suddenly expected me to have it all figured out.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-900 font-medium">
            But that breakdown? It planted a seed.
